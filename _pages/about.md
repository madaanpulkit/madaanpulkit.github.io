Hi! I am a Research Fellow at [The Wadhwani Institute of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.wadhwaniai.org/), an independent and nonprofit research institute, developing AI solutions for social good. 

At [Wadhwani AI](https://www.wadhwaniai.org/), I am currently working on the [AI-based Early Pest Warning System](https://www.wadhwaniai.org/work/cotton-farming/) for cotton farmers. I have also been a part of the [Cough Against Covid](https://www.wadhwaniai.org/work/cough-against-covid/) solution, where we were working on using cough as a biomarker to detect the presence of COVID-19.

I completed my Bachelor's in Biochemical Engineering from IIT Delhi where I enjoyed courses at the intersection of biochemical engineering and computer science. I was fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with [Prof. Lee Wei Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=P9DlZp4AAAAJ&hl=en) (NTHU, Taiwan) in the summers of 2018 and at [Elucidata](https://elucidata.io/), an AI based Biomedical Data Management startup in the summers of 2019.
