I am a Research Fellow at [Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.wadhwaniai.org/), a non-profit organisation using AI for Social Good. I am interested in working on theoretical as well as research that leads to on-ground change. My broad interests include Representation Learning, Machine Translation, Object Detection and Deep Learning in general. 

At Wadhwani AI I am currently woking on an AI solution for small to medium landholder farmers to predict pest infestation in their farms. This [project](https://www.wadhwaniai.org/work/cotton-farming) reached 15,000 farmers in 4 districts across 3 of the largest cotton-producing states in India, who saw a benefit through increase in profit as well as a reduction in pesticide cost.

I completed my Bachelors (with Honors) in Technology from [Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi (IIIT-Delhi)](https://www.iiitd.ac.in) in [Computer Science and Applied Mathematics](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/academics/btech/csam) with the Best Academic Performance [Award](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/convocation20/). I completed my [thesis](https://www.madaanpulkit.github.io/publications) on representation learning using clustering under the guidance of [Dr. Saket Anand]() and [Dr. Sushil Mittal]().
