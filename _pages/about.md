I am a MSE CS student at Johns Hopkins University's Whiting School of Engineering. 
For the past 2 years I was working as an Associate Machine Learning Scientist-I (formerly Research Fellow) at [Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.wadhwaniai.org/), a non-profit organisation using AI for Social Good. I am interested in working on AI solutions that lead to on-ground change. My broad interests include AI for Impact, AI for Social Good, Representation Learning, Machine Translation, Object Detection and Deep Learning in general.

At Wadhwani AI I extended, deployed and improved an AI solution for small to medium landholder farmers to predict pest infestation in their farms. This [project](https://www.wadhwaniai.org/programs/pest-management/) reached 15,000 farmers in 4 districts across 3 of the largest cotton-producing states in India, who saw a benefit through increase in profit as well as a reduction in pesticide cost. A part of my work here is up as a [preprint](/publications) at arXiv.

I completed my Bachelors in Technology (with Honors) from [Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi (IIIT-Delhi)](https://www.iiitd.ac.in) in [Computer Science and Applied Mathematics](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/academics/btech/csam) with the Best Academic Performance [Award](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/convocation20/). I completed my [thesis](/publications) on representation learning using clustering under the guidance of [Dr. Saket Anand](http://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~anands/) and [Dr. Sushil Mittal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sushilmittal/).

In the past I interned under the supervision of [Dr. Fatiha Sadat](https://professeurs.uqam.ca/professeur/sadat.fatiha/) at [DÃ©partement d'informatique](https://info.uqam.ca/), [UQAM](https://uqam.ca/), Canada as part of the Mitacs [Globalink Research Internship Program](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink/globalink-research-internship). Here, I worked on a creating a Deep Learning model capable of translating low resource languages. The results were submitted to othe [LoresMT Shared Task](https://sites.google.com/view/loresmt/loresmt-2019), where we were in the top 3 of the leaderboard in 3 tasks. The [work](/publications) also got published in [WILDRE-5](http://sanskrit.jnu.ac.in/conf/wildre5/index.jsp), a workshop under [LREC 2020](https://lrec2020.lrec-conf.org/en/). I've had the opportunity to work with [Dr. Kaushik Kalyanaraman](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/kaushik) and [Dr. Ojaswa Sharma](http://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~ojaswa/) on [reconstructing 3-D surfaces from curved cross-sections](). I also worked At [MIDAS Labs](http://midas.iiitd.edu.in/), under the guidance of [Dr. Rajiv Ratn Shah](http://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~rajivratn/), for a short period on using SOTA ASR models, like Jasper. I'vs also been part of LCS2 Lab, under [Dr. Tanmoy Chakraborty](https://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~tanmoy/), on detection sockpuppets in online discussion forums. 

Apart from all the cool nerd stuff, you'll find me playing football and reading (sometimes [writing](/blog) too) about space-stuff in general. More about the non-academic me [here](/madpulsar).
